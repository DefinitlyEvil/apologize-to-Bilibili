# APOLOGIZE TO THE PUBLIC
  I am very sorry that this plugin and its code was copied from another person. I made up all the words about he paying me to make this plugin.
  I found his code on the Internet (from bilibili) and I decompiled it.
  I have some statements to make:

1. I did NOT receive payment or any contract.
2. I do NOT know him and he does not know about me at all.
3. I know my deeds caused severe reputation damage to that person and he is a great person. I have sent apologize messages on Bilibili and hopefully he will accept it.
4. I will DELETE all stolen files and CLEAN UP all associated code repositories.
5. I will DELETE my MCBBS posts at once!
